# Free-form borders with `border-shape`

## User need
Non-rectangular shapes are already everywhere on the web. However, the current limitations of the web platform allow using them only for clipping, or for standalone shapes in the form of SVG.
Creating a simple speech bubble that paints its border and clips its internal contents requires both clip-path, SVG, and multiple elements.

## Existing Solutions
Currently, the toolkit for web authors to decorate elements in a non-rectangular way contains:
- SVG: this requires setting up a tree of elements separate from styling, and clip the element separately.
- `clip-path`: this clips the border, as well as effects like shadow/blur.
- `corner-shape`: this allows more expressive shapes than before, however it is still limited to box-like shapes.

## Proposed solution
The proposed solution is to allow authors to specify one or two basic shapes that define the border's contour.
The given shape(s) would be strokes, and if two are given, the area between them would be filled.
The area inside the internal shape would clip the content for `overflow: hidden` (or scroll/clip etc.)
This is documented in the [draft spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-borders-4/#border-shape).

## Alternatives considered

### Changing the semantics of `clip-path`
This doesn't seem right because clipping a shape can be useful regardless of border-shaping.

### Taking the colors and width from the `border-*` properties
This is still under consideration, but it's complicated because it's unclear which "side" maps to which parts of an arbitrary shape.
Using `fill` and `stroke` is more of a straightforward solution.

This is also why `corner-shape` was needed despite of `border-shape` being more expressive.
`border-shape` and `corner-shape` have a different set of constraints, expressions as well as ergonomics, that are not possible with the alternative.
While `border-shape` allows full expression with shapes, this kind of flexibility comes at a cost: some of the aforementioned traditional "border" features become infeasible.
With `corner-shape`, we can have superellipse-defined corners and the full expression of 4 borders and 4 corners (width, color, style),
while with the general purpose `border-shape` the solution remains a uniform stroke width and color, plus whatever style of stroking available (joins, dash-array, caps).
